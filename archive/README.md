# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived files that are no longer used in the main application but are kept for reference purposes.

## Files

- **app_original.py**: The original monolithic application file before restructuring. This contains all the functionality including metric cards, word clouds, interaction heatmaps, and all features. This was the working version that has been restored to the main directory as `app.py`.

- **main_modular.py**: The modular refactored application that was created following industrial best practices. This version separated the code into multiple modules but may have had some functionality changes that the user wanted to revert.

## Note

- The current active application is `app.py` (restored from app_original.py)  
- These archived files are kept for reference and comparison purposes
- The modular version (main_modular.py) can be used as a reference for future refactoring efforts
